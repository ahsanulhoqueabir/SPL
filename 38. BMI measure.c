//Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of health. It can be calculated by taking your
//weight in kilograms and dividing by the square of your height in meters. Write a program
//that prompts the user to enter a weight in pounds and height in inches and displays the
//BMI. Note that 1 pound is 0.4536 kilogram, and 1 inch is 0.0254 meter.

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
float wp, hi, wk, hm, bmi;
// Prompt the user to enter weight in pounds
printf("Enter weight in pounds: ");
scanf("%f", &wp);
// Prompt the user to enter height in inches
printf("Enter height in inches: ");
scanf("%f", &hi);
// Convert weight from pounds to kilograms
wk = wp * 0.4536;
// Convert height from inches to meters
hm = hi * 0.0254;
// Calculate BMI
bmi = wk / (hm * hm);
// Display the BMI
printf("BMI: %.2f\n", bmi);
